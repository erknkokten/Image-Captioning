We provided 3 .py and 3 .ipynb file. If you want to run the code, you can run it in Google Colab.
To do so, the Google Drive link which includes the dataset paths alongside with model check points is given below.

IMPORTANT NOTE: YOU CANNOT RUN THE GIVEN CODES IN YOUR COMPUTER, OR EVEN IN YOUR OWN COLAB ENVIRONMENT. YOU NEED TO HAVE .pkl AND .h5 FILES TO PROCEED. FOR THE FINAL PROJECT OF EE443 COURSE, EVERYTHING YOU NEED IS AVAILABLE IN THE DRIVE LINK PROVIDED ABOVE. CONNECT IT IN YOUR COLAB ENVIRONMENT, AND YOU ARE READY TO GO.

This code is now set to be using the latest checkpoint, only for **TESTING PURPOSES**. In this way, the code will not train anything. If you want to see training results, turn the flag below **False**.
